#### tl;dr I created the Inference Resource Center to provide users with an approachable way of learning to use the Studio application for the purpose of empowering the users, saving money and saving engineering/support resources. It was very well received and became an indispensable resource for the company.


When I first started work at Inference (a mature startup at the time), it was clear that the application was created *by* engineers *for* engineers. The only issue of course is that the customers were not engineers. Not even close. Some were enterprises, others were government agencies, but a lot of them were just regular consumer-level, non-technical folk. 

One way Inference attempted to empower these non-technical customers to achieve success within a complex self-service application was by providing on-site and remote training. This involved four (4) full days of Studio training. It was a lot for a new user to learn, and it was expensive to run.<

Another option they had was provided technical documentation and usage guidelines. However, these were also written by engineers and ended up making customers feel stupid whenever they attempted to read them. 

New to the company I was tasked with not only re-writing this documentation but also developing a knowledge portal where customers could get up to speed via tutorials and walkthroughs, but still have access to technical reference material when required. I dubbed this the Inference Resource Center.

The initial suggestion was that I would need to attend the prerequisite 4-day training so that I understood how the platform worked etc. I refused.

Part of my approach for this was to go in completely blind and really feel how it felt for a new, non-technical user within the platform. I really wanted to empathize with the user, experience the same pitfalls, the same imposter syndrome and struggle my way through. 

I took countless notes through the process and after several months I had not only re-written the entire docs from scratch, but had also expanded it into providing tutorials and live (and recorded) webinars. 

The feedback from customers was phenomenal and the gratitude from the on-call support staff (who were being bothered less and less during the night) was palpable.

Since this project, Inference was acquired by Five9, inc. Some legacy customers still use the original Studio 6 application and related documentation resources but there has been no additional features to the platform or additions to the resource center.
